# Date and Time transformation

```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(across(c(tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime), ymd_hms))

df %>%
  select(tpep_pickup_datetime, tpep_dropoff_datetime) %>%
  head()
```

# Adding a month column
```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    pickup_month = month(tpep_pickup_datetime),
    dropoff_month = month(tpep_dropoff_datetime)
  )

df %>%
  select(pickup_month, dropoff_month) %>%
  head()
```

# Adding a day in the week column
```{r}
df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    pickup_day = wday(tpep_pickup_datetime, week_start = 1),
    dropoff_day = wday(tpep_dropoff_datetime, week_start = 1)
  )

df %>% 
  select(pickup_day, dropoff_day) %>%
  head()
```

# How many trips were during the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) and during the weekdays (Monday - Friday) percentage wise?
```{r}
df %>%
  filter(pickup_day %in% 1:5 | dropoff_day %in% 1:5) %>%
  summarise(Mon_Fri=n() / nrow(df) * 100, Sat_Sun = 100 - Mon_Fri)
```

Do drivers get more tips during the weekday or weekend?
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate(day_type = ifelse(pickup_day %in% 1:5 & dropoff_day %in% 1:5, "Weekday", "Weekend")) %>%
  group_by(day_type) %>%
  summarise(avg_tip = mean(tip_amount))
